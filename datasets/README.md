# Dataset Information

This project uses OpenAI GPT-4 Vision for wardrobe analysis, so no local dataset is required.

For demo purposes, you can use any fashion/wardrobe images:
- Upload via Streamlit UI
- Provide image URLs to the API

## Sample Image Sources
- Unsplash fashion collections
- Personal wardrobe photos
- Fashion e-commerce product images

The VisionAgent will analyze any clothing image in real-time using GPT-4 Vision.
